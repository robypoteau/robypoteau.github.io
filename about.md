I am Roby and this is space for me to explore writing and content creation. Having spent most of my existence in school, I wanted to start giving back. Here I hope to share my research, some personal thoughts and experiences. There is some apprehension about publicly posting my written works, but something I've learned is that it's important to take risk in life. Though it might feel vulnerable, it's there, in that vulnerability, that I will also find great joy. Also, to the best of my knowledge you only live once and I'd rather not to look back with many *ragrets*.
